| ------------------- |:------------------- |
| **Operation medium** | The Underwater GPS system will ONLY work with both a Locator and the Receivers in water. It will not work in air. |
| **Max voltage** | The absolute maximum voltage rating of the equipment is 30V. Voltages above this will damage the electronics. |
| **Temperature** | Make sure the system does not overheat. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight over extended periods of time. |
| **Salt water** | The contents of the Topside housing will corrode and/or short if in contact with salt water. Keep the housing lid closed when in the field to avoid salt water getting inside. |
| **Force** | Avoid using excessive force on connectors, screws and other parts of the system as this can lead to mechanical failure. |
