To minimize the time between a customer gets the DVL-A50 and to having it up and running on their hardware platform, the DVL-A50 is shipped with an attached IO interface providing ease of connectivity with power, ethernet and serial.. However, for most ROVs and AUVs the DVL-A50 has to be integrated with the on-board electronics through a penetrator or a subsea connector. This guide details how the DVL-A50 can be integrated with the BlueROV2. Parts and tools What parts and tools are needed depends on whether you intend to permanently attach the DVL-A50 to the BlueROV2, have it semi-permanently attached, or use a subsea connector for quick installation/removal. Installation type Option Permanent with penetrator and IO Interface 1 Semi-permanent with penetrator and connectors 2 Subsea connector 3 You will need The following are needed for all installation options: BlueROV2 Hex Key Set Penetrator Wrench BlueROV2 mounting bracket . This is optional, but protects the DVL-A50 and allows for 0 cm minimum altitude. You will also need 5 mm universal drill bit 2 x M5x12 mm stainless steel pan head screws (included with BlueROV2 mounting bracket) 4 x M3x4 mm stainless steel countersunk flat head screws (included with BlueROV2 mounting bracket) De-/soldering iron Utility knife Wire stripping tool Preparation Seperate IO Interface from DVL-A50 The first thing you will have to do before going about any of the installation options is to cut the DVL-A50 cable, separating the IO Interface board. We recommend you do so near the end where the IO Interface board is to begin with. Warning The DVL-A50 cable is permanently attached and non-replacable inside the DVL-A50. If you cut the cable too short you will either have to splice the cable with another cable, or order a new DVL-A50. Measure twice, cut once! Attaching the BlueROV2 mounting bracket Attach the BlueROV2 mounting bracket to the DVL-A50 using 4 x M3x6 screws. The BlueROV2 mounting bracket can be attached to the BlueROV2 in one of the 2 places indicated in the image below (standard BlueROV2). Note In this configuration the DVL-A50 is pointing backwards meaning both the x-direction and the y-direction are flipped. Multiplying the velocity data in x- and y-direction with -1 will flip coordinates back again to the same perspective frame of the BlueROV2. If your BlueROV2 has the Heavy Configuration upgrade, the BlueROV2 mounting bracket can be attached such that the DVL-A50 is within the BlueROV2 frame. Mark 2 hole positions on the BlueROV2 frame for attaching the BlueROV2 mounting bracket and drill through the frame using a 5 mm universal drill bit. Check that the BlueROV2 mounting bracket will attach properly to the BlueROV2 frame using 2 x M5x12 mm screws, but do not secure the bracket in place as more work is needed on the cable end. Final cable lenght With the DVL-A50 now attached to the BlueROV2 frame, find the appropriate cable length needed by leading the cable back to the penetrator end cap of the BlueROV2 and add length of the electronics enclosure (30 cm). This is the minimum required cable length. Note We recommend adding atleast another 30 cm to the cable to provide enough service loop in case the penetrator fails or the leads get damaged. Cut the cable to the final length. Option 1. Permanent installation with penetrator and IO Interface The DVL-A50 is permanently installed on the BlueROV2 with the IO Interface board which is supplied with the DVL-A50. For this installation you will additionally need: M10 Cable Penetrator for 6mm Cable from Blue Robotics Potting compound (possible options in appendix A) Potting kit from Blue Robotics Solder wire Tweezer or nose pliers Solder wick and/or desoldering pump IO Interface preparation Cut off the zip tie holding the cable onto the IO Interface board Cut off the individual wires soldered onto the IO Interface board. Leave enough wire to grab onto with a tweezer or nose pliers. Desolder all the cut wires. Use solder wick and/or a desoldering pump to remove any excess solder from the now desoldered through hole pads. Warning Using too much force or heat may delaminate the IO Interface PCB, rendering the IO Interface board useless. Adding a penetrator Note The penetrator will be pottet using a potting compound. Most potting compounds need several hours or days to harden, so prepare a space where the potting can be left undisturbed for longer periods. Note also that working with potting compounds may get messy, so place old newspapers or some cardboard over the work area, and have single use tissue nearby to clean any mess. Strip off 25-30 cm of the cable jacket using a utility knife or a sharp blade. Take care not to cut into the leads inside the cable. Feed the now exposed leads through the penetrator starting from the head, and continue feeding until the cable jacket is situated within the shoulder of the penetrator. With the threads of the penetrator pointing downwards and the cable pointing upwards, pour potting compound into the space between the cable and the penetrator. Fill with potting compound until it is flush with the top of the penetrator. Tip Use a clamping vice to hold the penetrator in place while pouring the potting compund. Let the potting compound harden before proceding. Turn the penetrator upside downs and fill the gap between the leads with more potting compound. Let the potting compound fully cure before proceding. Removing a blank penetrator To remove a blank penetrator from your BlueROV2, you will need the following tools: 2.5 mm hex driver #1 Phillips head screwdriver Penetrator wrench To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3\u201d enclosure and place to the side. Remove the fairings and buoyancy blocks by removing the self-tapping screws that hold the fairings to the frame. Remove the 4\u201d electronics enclosure from the ROV by removing the M3x16 screws that mount the enclosure to the ROV cradle. Remove the Vent Plug from the Vent Penetrator Bolt on the electronics enclosure. Remove the 4\u2033 tube and forward dome assembly from the rear end cap. Remove the blank penetrator as pictured from the 4\u201d End Cap with the penetrator wrench that came with the BlueROV2 kit. Install DVL-A50 penetrator To install DVL-A50 into the end cap, you will need the following parts and tools: DVL-A50 with pre-installed cable penetrator Penetrator Nut (Black) Penetrator O-ring Silicone Grease \u2013 10g Tube Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe Penetrator wrench Wipe the exterior surface of the electronics enclosure end cap clean with isopropyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol wipes, and make sure it is free of any particles in the areas where the penetrator O-ring will sit. Remove the O-ring from the bag and apply silicone grease to it. Install the O-ring onto the DVL-A50 cable penetrator. Install the DVL-A50 cable penetrator on to the end cap in the hole you previously removed the blank penetrator from. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrench to tighten it an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can\u2019t loosen it with your fingers, it is tight enough. Reinstall IO Interface board With the DVL-A50 penetrator now through the 4\" End Cap, resolder the leads of the DVL-A50 cable to the IO Interface board.

Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). This allows clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series) easily.","title":"Bluerov integration"},{"location":"dvl/bluerov-integration/#introduction","text":"The Water Linked DVL-A50 is designed to integrate with most ROVs and AUVs through ethernet and/or a serial interface (UART).

This means it will attempt to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on the same network. For convenience the DVL supports mDNS to easily discover the assigned IP address. The mDNS name used for the DVL is: waterlinked-dvl . Note If no DHCP server is avaiable on the network, it is recommended to configure a static ip address as the DVL can use up to 5 minutes searching for a DHCP server. Web GUI On operating systems supporting mDNS you can open the web GUI via the following URL: http://waterlinked-dvl . If mDNS is not supported you need to obtain the IP address of the DVL and use that in your browser (http://IP_ADDRESS). The web GUI shows the status of the DVL (velocity and altitude) as well as diagnostic information. The web GUI also allows for network configuration. Network config The DVL has two IP configuration options though the web GUI: DCHP client, where it obtains an IP address from a DHCP server on the same network. Static mode where the user sets the wanted IP address for the DVL. Once the IP configuration is modified the DVL needs to be rebooted for the settings take effect. TCP Output The DVL supports sending measurements updates using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). A TCP server is available on port 16171 which outputs the latest measurements to all the connected clients. In the web GUI you can see the number of connected clients and the format of the output message. See description of the output protocol . Software update To get the best performance of the DVL it is recommended to always run the latest software. The update GUI can automatically check if a new software version is available. Automatic software update The easiest way of checking if a new version is available is to connect the DVL to the internet and let the upgrade GUI automatically check for a new version: Connect the DVL ethernet to a network where the internet is available and make sure the DVL network configuration allows access to the internet. Go to http://waterlinked-dvl:9000 or http://IP_ADDRESS:9000. The upgrade GUI will automatically check if there is a new version available and allow installation of new upgrade with a single click.

The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface. The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. The Locator is placed on the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse.

The steps are: Power the topside unit Calibrate IMU Deploying receivers Connect everything Select locator and channel Configure receiver placement in GUI Power the topside unit Start by connecting power to the topside unit. We do this first because we want the GPS receiver to start receiving signals and acheive a lock while we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-S1, power it on now so it also have time to get GPS lock. Calibrate IMU Connect the Ethernet cable to the topside unit and your computer. Then open your web browser and type in the IP-address of your topside unit which is defined by the position of the dip-switch on the Master-D1. How to change the IP-address is described here . At the top bar on the GUI you will see a calibration bar for the IMU. To calibrate the IMU rotate it in a figure of 8 and keep doing it until the IMU calibration bar becomes full and green. Deploying of receivers Before starting to deploy the receivers in the water, add a piece of tape on the receiver cable on the desired depth to make setup easier. Place the receivers in the water on the desired location and decide which number (1-4) each receiver will have. This is important when connecting the receivers to the topside unit. Tip Adding lead weights just above the receiver helps keep them stable when doing the positioning. Connect everything When connecting the receiver cables to the topside unit remember the numbering you decided on and connect the connector to the accordingly port. If this is not correct the position will be completely wrong. Next you connect the Locator if you are using the A1 or D1. Select locator and channel Now that everything is connected and ready it is time to select the right locator and choose which channal to listen on. This is configurated on the setting page of the web GUI. The Water Linked standard is to use channel 17 and this is also the default channel for the Locator-S1. Configure receiver placement and seach range in GUI After selecting the correct locator, you need to provide the correct placement of the receivers to the GUI for the positioning to work correctly. This is done by drag'n drop of each receiver to the correct placment relative to the topside unit. The position of each receiver is seen below in the map view. It you click on the receiver you get a pop up with the possibility to write its exact placment. Once this is done you can limit the search range by using the same drag and drop feature. Warning If you are using the Locator-A1 or S1, you need to provide depth information to the topside unit. Description on how to do this is found here . Tip Reducing the search range helps to improve the performance of the system. It is recomended to limith this range if you are operating in a smaller area. This is especially important in tanks. You are now ready to explore the underwater world and knowing where you are at the same time.","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"explorer-kit/quickstart/#quickstart","text":"","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"explorer-kit/quickstart/#intro","text":"This is a guide on how to start using the Underwater GPS system.

In order to ensure the best performance, you should follow a few guidelines: Line-of-sight Try to place the Receivers so they all have a free line-of-sight to the Locator. Good Separation The system performs better when there is a decent distance between the Receivers. More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good performance. Max Range There should be maximum of 100m from any Receiver to the Locator Receiver Depth Place the Receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically small air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the acoustic signal and can reduce the system performance. Limit search area You will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the search area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is expected to be. Directivity The Receivers and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters. Receiver stability Add some weight to the Receiver cable just above the Receiver so they hang straight down in the water On board GPS If the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the static option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS Receiver in global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving eg. if mounted to a boat. Reference Systems In order to calculate the absolute position of the Locator we need to define two reference systems, the acoustic and the global reference system. The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and in maps. The acoustic reference system (the x and y axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (x=0, y=0). A label on top of the lid indicates the x-y coordinate system. Boat Example The illustration bellow shows a typical Receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The Receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the Receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator. Notice how the housing defines the origin and coordinate system of the acoustic reference system.","title":"Receivers"},{"location":"explorer-kit/gui/receivers/#receivers","text":"","title":"Receivers"},{"location":"explorer-kit/gui/receivers/#receiver-guidelines","text":"You may place the Receivers at any location within 100m from the top-side housing / Master_D1.

The Water Linked BlueROV2 Integration Kit provides the necessary components to seamlessly connect the BlueROV2 and the Underwater GPS. This page specifically covers using the BlueROV2 Integration Kit to connect the Underwater GPS with the BlueRobotics BlueROV2. Parts and tools The Locator-A1 and Locator-U1 are the only Locators that will work together with the BlueROV2 Integration Kit as the Locator bulkhead on the Underwater GPS will be altered and used for connection to the BlueROV2. You will need BlueROV2 Hex Key Set Penetrator Wrench BlueROV2 Integration Kit You will also need: #1 Phillips head screwdriver Optional: Bottle of treadlocker Soldering iron Installing the Locator-A1 on the BlueROV2 You will need to install the Locator-A1 on the BlueROV2 using components from the BlueROV2 Integration Kit. The Locator will use one of the spare cable penetrations in the back of the BlueROV2 and will connect to the spare green and white twisted pair in the tether. Note The Locator-A1 requires a mounting bracket to attach it to the BlueROV2. You can find a 3D model of a suitable mounting bracket here which you can 3D print as is, or modify to your needs. Altenativly you can simply attach the Locator-A1 to the BlueROV2 using zip ties. Just make sure the Locator-A1 has free line-of-sight towards the Receivers near the surface. Removing a blank penetrator To remove a blank penetrator from your BlueROV2, you will need the following tools: 2.5 mm hex driver #1 Phillips head screwdriver Penetrator wrench To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3\u201d enclosure and place to the side. Remove the fairings and buoyancy blocks by removing the self-tapping screws that hold the fairings to the frame. Remove the 4\u201d electronics enclosure from the ROV by removing the M3x16 screws that mount the enclosure to the ROV cradle. Remove the Vent Plug from the Vent Penetrator Bolt on the electronics enclosure. Remove the 4\u2033 tube and forward dome assembly from the rear end cap. Remove the blank penetrator as pictured from the 4\u201d End Cap with the penetrator wrench that came with the BlueROV2 kit. Install Locator-A1 penetrator To install Locator-A1 into the end cap, you will need the following parts and tools: Locator-A1 with pre-installed cable penetrator Penetrator Nut (Black) Penetrator O-ring Silicone Grease \u2013 10g Tube Isopropyl Alcohol Wipe Penetrator wrench Wipe the exterior surface of the electronics enclosure end cap clean with isopropyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol wipes, and make sure it is free of any particles in the areas where the penetrator O-ring will sit. Remove the O-ring from the bag and apply silicone grease to it. Install the O-ring onto the Locator-A1 cable penetrator. Install the Locator-A1 cable penetrator on to the end cap in the hole you previously removed the blank penetrator from. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrench to tighten it an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can\u2019t loosen it with your fingers, it is tight enough. Using the pre-crimped header pin connector on the Locator-A1, connect the Locator wires (green/white) to a spare twisted pair of the tether (green/white). Reasemble BlueROV2 electronics enclosure To reassemble your BlueROV2 Electronics Enclosure, you will need the following parts and tools: 4 x M3x16 screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly Silicone Grease \u2013 10g Tube 2.5 mm hex driver Reinstall 4\u201d Watertight Enclosure onto ROV with the following steps: Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray then install the Watertight Enclosure (4\u201d Series) with installed Dome End Cap to the O-Ring Flange (4\u201d Series). Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series). This allows clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4\u201d Series) easily. Mounting the Locator-A1 to the BlueROV2 frame To mount the Locator-A1 to the BlueROV2 frame, you will need the following parts and tools: Aluminum Locator-A1 mounting bracket (2 halves)4 x M3x16 socket head cap screws (Not included) 2 x M5x12 button head cap screws 2.5 mm hex driver 3 mm hex driver (Optional) Bottle of threadlocker Route the Locator to one side of the ROV. Attach the aluminum mounting bracket to the Locator-A1 using the M3x16 socket head screws. (Optional) add threadlocker to screw threads before securing. Secure the mounting bracket to the existing holes on the ROV frame. Modifications inside Underwater GPS housing Connecting ethernet cable To connect ethernet from the Interface Electronics board to the Master Electronics board, you will need the following part: Ethernet cable (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) Locate the ethernet ports on the Interface Electronics board and the Master Electronics board. Connect the included ethernet cable to the two ports. Installing the PLC module To install the PLC module to the Interface Electronics board, you will need the following part: LX200V30 PLC Homeplug module with press-fit standoffs(included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) Locate the socket for the Homeplug module on the Interface board. Press the PLC module into the socket, making sure that the press-fit standoffs latch into the holes in the Interface Electronics board. Interface Electronics modification (Optional) Warning Skipping this step leaves a regulated 12V power source from the Underwater GPS on the PLC lines (pins 1 (GND) and 2 (12V) on the Locator bulkhead). Connecting non-isolated equipment to the PLC lines may damage the Underwater GPS or any external equipment. The Interface Electronics board in the Underwater GPS housing comes with the resistors R2 and R3 attached. These put GND on pin 1 and 12V on pin 2 of the bulkhead connector with the label \u201cLocator\u201d. The configuration of the FXTI, BlueROV2 and the Locator-A1 as presented in this guide is not affected by leaving these resistors on the board. In any other configuration, you should assess whether or not removing R2 and R3 is necessary for safe operation. Modifications to FXTI The connections made inside the FXTI will connect the ROV, Topside Computer, and Water Linked systems to each other. Here\u2019s a high level diagram of what that will look like: To enable connection between the Underwater GPS and the FXTI, you need the following parts and tools: Bulkhead wire assembly (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) Brown/white jumper lead (included in the BlueROV2 Integration Kit) 2 mm hex driver Unscrew the bulkhead panel from the FXTI and remove one of the black plastic plugs from one of the auxiliary ports. Thread the FXTI Binder pigtail wire assembly into the open port and secure in place with the included bulkhead nut.

The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. A Locator is attached to the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, four Receiver hydrophones are lowered into the water to receive the beacon signal. The Receivers listen for the pulse from the Locator.

The steps are: Power the Topside unit Calibrate IMUs Deploying Antenna/Receivers Connect everything Select Locator and channel Configure Antenna/Receiver placement in GUI Power the topside unit Start by connecting power to the topside unit. We do this first because we want the GPS Receiver to start receiving signals and acheive a lock while we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-U1, power it on now so it also have time to get GPS lock. Connect with Underwater GPS Connect to the WiFi access point UnderwaterGPS on your PC/tablet/smartphone. Password for WiFi is waterlinked . Navigate to http://192.168.7.1/ in a web browser to access the Underwater GPS web GUI. Calibrate IMUs At the top bar on the GUI you will see a calibration bar for the IMU. To calibrate the IMU rotate it in a figure of 8 and keep doing it until the IMU calibration bar becomes full and green. Select Locator and channel Select the right Locator and choose which channal to listen on. This is configurated on the setting page of the web GUI. The Water Linked standard is to use channel 2. This is also the default channel for the Locator-U1. Warning If you are using the Locator-A1 you need to provide depth information to the topside unit. Description on how to do this is found here . Deploying of Antenna/Receivers Antenna Unfold the Antenna and lock the mast straight using the latches on the folding joints. Secure the three arms in place using the thumb screw. Place the Antenna in water at the desired location. Secure the Antenna using the RAM Mount components included with the Antenna. Tip If the RAM Mount components included with the Antenna does not accurately fit your needs, you can find many alternative RAM Mount Arms and Bases which will fit the C-Size here . Receivers Before starting to deploy the Receivers in the water, add a piece of tape on the Receiver cable on the desired depth to make setup easier. Place the Receivers in the water on the desired location and decide which number (1-4) each Receiver will have. This is important when connecting the Receivers to the topside unit. Tip Adding lead weights just above the Receiver helps keep them stable when doing the positioning. Connect everything When connecting the Receiver cables to the Topside unit remember the numbering you decided on and connect the connector to the accordingly port. If this is not correct the position will be completely wrong. Next you connect the Locator if you are using the A1 or D1. Configure Antenna/Receiver placement and seach range in GUI After selecting the correct Locator, you need to provide the correct placement of the Antenna/Receivers to the GUI for the positioning to work correctly. This is done by either drag'n drop of each Receiver to the correct placment relative to the topside unit, or by entering the Receiver positions manually. For the Antenna you can only enter the position manually under Advanced settings . Limit the search area by changing the radius, direction and sector size. Tip Reducing the search range helps to improve the performance of the system. It is recomended to limith this range if you are operating in a smaller area. This is especially important in tanks and pools.

The signals should be well above the noise floor. Interference Acoustic interference can be observed in the diagnostic plot. Echo sounders from your boat or nearby boats typically appears like burst noise. If it is coming from your boat, try to turn off the echo sounder to improve position accuracy.

Note The Forward direction of the Antenna must align with the Forward direction of the Topside to get correct global position. Line-of-sight Try to place the Antenna so that it has free line-of-sight to the Locator. Antenna Depth Place the Antenna at 1 meters depth, indicated by the top folding joint of the mast. Limit search area You will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the search area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is expected to be. Directivity The Antenna and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters. Antenna stability Secure the Antenna tightly to the vessel using the provided Ram Mount Receiver-D1 Guidelines You may place the Receivers at any location within 100m from the Topside housing. In order to ensure the best performance, you should follow a few guidelines: Line-of-sight Try to place the Receivers so they all have a free line-of-sight to the Locator. Good Separation The system performs better when there is a decent distance between the Receivers. More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good performance. Receiver Depth Place the Receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically small air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the acoustic signal and can reduce the system performance. Limit search area You will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the search area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is expected to be. Directivity The Receivers and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters. Receiver stability Add some weight to the Receiver cable just above the Receiver so they hang straight down in the water On board GPS If the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the static option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS Receiver in global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving, eg. if mounted to a boat. Reference Systems In order to calculate the absolute position of the Locator we need to define two reference systems, the acoustic and the global reference system. The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and maps. The acoustic reference system (the Forward axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (black square). A label on top of the lid indicates the forward direction. Boat Example The illustration bellow shows a typical Receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The Receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the Receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator. Notice how the housing defines the origin and coordinate system of the acoustic reference system.","title":"Receivers"},{"location":"underwater-gps/gui/receivers/#receivers","text":"","title":"Receivers"},{"location":"underwater-gps/gui/receivers/#quick-deply-antenna-guidelines","text":"You may place the Antenna at any location up to 10m from the Topside housing (limited by cable).
